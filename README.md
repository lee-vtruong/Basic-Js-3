## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

- **`README.md`**: This documentation file.
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file containing the structure and content of the exercises, including input fields, buttons, and output areas for displaying results.  Uses Bootstrap for styling and layout.
- **`index.js`**: The JavaScript file containing the logic for each exercise, including event listeners and array manipulation functions.
- **`style.css`**: The CSS file for additional styling and customization beyond Bootstrap's default styles.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS3**: For styling the website, including layout, colors, and animations.  Includes custom styles in `style.css`.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the array manipulation logic for each exercise, including event handling and dynamic content updates.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For basic styling and layout components, providing a responsive and consistent look.
- **Font Awesome**: For adding icons to the UI, enhancing visual appeal and clarity.

## Features

The project includes the following array manipulation exercises:

- **1. Sum of Positive Numbers:** Calculates the sum of all positive numbers in the array.
- **2. Count Positive Numbers:** Counts the number of positive numbers in the array.
- **3. Find Minimum Number:** Finds the smallest number in the array.
- **4. Find Minimum Positive Number:** Finds the smallest positive number in the array.
- **5. Find Last Even Number:** Finds the last even number in the array. If no even numbers are present, it returns -1.
- **6. Swap Elements:** Swaps the positions of two elements in the array based on user-specified indices.
- **7. Sort Ascending:** Sorts the array in ascending order.
- **8. Find First Prime Number:** Finds the first prime number in the array. If no prime numbers are present, it returns -1.
- **9. Count Integer (Specific Value):** Counts how many times a specific integer (input by the user) appears in the array.
- **10. Compare Positive and Negative Counts:** Compares the number of positive and negative numbers in the array, indicating whether there are more positive numbers, more negative numbers, or an equal number of each.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd [project directory name]
    ```

3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser.**

    The website should now be displayed correctly in your browser, allowing you to interact with the exercises. Add numbers to the array using the input field and then click the accordion sections to run the array manipulations.

## Customization

-   **Styles:** Modify `style.css` to change the look and feel of the website, including colors, fonts, and layout adjustments beyond Bootstrap's default styling.
-   **Logic:** Update the JavaScript logic within `index.js` to modify the calculations, add new exercises, improve existing functionality, or implement more robust input validation.
-   **HTML Structure:** Adjust the HTML structure in `index.html` to modify form elements, input fields, output areas, or change the overall layout using Bootstrap components.
